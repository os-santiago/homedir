# Security Policy

EventFlow takes the security of our users and contributors seriously. If you believe you‚Äôve found a vulnerability, please follow the process below to help us fix it quickly and responsibly.

---

## ‚úÖ Supported Versions (Major-only)

We support **only the currently active major release line**. When a new major is released, all previous majors become **unsupported** (EOL) immediately.

**Current active major (as of 2025-08-09): `2.x`**

| Version | Supported                 |
|--------:|---------------------------|
| 2.x     | ‚úÖ Active (features + security) |
| < 2.x   | ‚ùå Unsupported             |

> This major-only policy keeps the project fast and secure in line with our trunk-based development approach.

## üîè Disclosure & CVE

- We will publish a **GitHub Security Advisory** with details, credits (if desired), and fixed versions.
- When appropriate, we will request a **CVE ID** and reference it in the advisory and release notes.

## üõ°Ô∏è Safe Harbor for Good-Faith Research

We do not pursue or support legal action for **good-faith security research** that:
- Avoids privacy violations, service degradation, or data destruction/exfiltration
- Respects rate limits and only uses your own accounts/data
- Stops testing and reports immediately upon finding a vulnerability
- Keeps details confidential until a fix is available and a coordinated disclosure is agreed

Out-of-scope activities include social engineering, physical attacks, spam, and DDoS.
