# Getting started with Quarkus

This is a minimal CRUD service exposing a couple of endpoints over REST.

Under the hood, this demo uses:

- RESTEasy to expose the REST endpoints
- REST-assured and JUnit 5 for endpoint testing

## Requirements

To compile and run this demo you will need:

- JDK 21
- GraalVM

### Configuring GraalVM and JDK 21

Make sure that both the `GRAALVM_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME` environment variables have
been set, and that a JDK 21 `java` command is on the path.

See the [Building a Native Executable guide](https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image-guide)
for help setting up your environment.

## Building the application

Launch the Maven build on the checked out sources of this demo:

> mvn package

### Live coding with Quarkus

The Maven Quarkus plugin provides a development mode that supports
live coding. To try this out:

> mvn quarkus:dev

This command will leave Quarkus running in the foreground listening on port 8080.

1. Visit the default endpoint: [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080).
    - Make a simple change to [src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/index.html](src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/index.html) file.
    - Refresh the browser to see the updated page.

### Run Quarkus in JVM mode

When you're done iterating in developer mode, you can run the application as a
conventional jar file.

First compile it:

> mvn package

Then run it:

> java -jar ./target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar

Have a look at how fast it boots, or measure the total native memory consumption.

### Run Quarkus as a native executable

You can also create a native executable from this application without making any
source code changes. A native executable removes the dependency on the JVM:
everything needed to run the application on the target platform is included in
the executable, allowing the application to run with minimal resource overhead.

Compiling a native executable takes a bit longer, as GraalVM performs additional
steps to remove unnecessary codepaths. Use the  `native` profile to compile a
native executable:

> mvn package -Dnative

After getting a cup of coffee, you'll be able to run this executable directly:

> ./target/eventflow-2.2.1-runner


## Google Login Demo

1. Set the environment variables `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` and the rest of the OAuth values listed in the project root README.
2. Start the application in dev mode:

```bash
mvn quarkus:dev
```

3. Visit [https://eventflow.opensourcesantiago.io/private](https://eventflow.opensourcesantiago.io/private). You will be redirected to authenticate with Google.
4. After login the private page shows your name, email and profile picture.

## JWT verification in production

Configure SmallRye JWT to validate Google ID tokens against Google's public keys:

```
%prod.mp.jwt.verify.issuer=https://accounts.google.com
%prod.smallrye.jwt.verify.key-location=https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs
%prod.mp.jwt.verify.audiences=${GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID}
%prod.smallrye.jwt.verify.algorithm=RS256
```

Set the `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` environment variable to your OAuth client ID so that
tokens with a matching `aud` claim are accepted. Adjust the `issuer` value if
your tokens use `accounts.google.com` without the `https` scheme.
