# User history - "Mass load without pain"

I am Rodrigo, Logistics Coordinator. I have all the talks in a JSON file. In the admin panel I will import ", I upload the file and in seconds the sessions appear on the platform.

If the file has an ID duplicate, the app tells me which line to review. If there is an error in the format, I get a clear message to correct it.

I feel efficient:

- Do not display data by data.
- Errors are detected before publishing.
- I can repeat import as many times.

Result: I migrate my complete agenda at once and the app is ready for attendees.
