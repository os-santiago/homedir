# User history - "Notifications that accompany me without hindering"

I am Carolina. I enter Eventflow from the cell phone, I reviewed "Available events" and record my favorite talks. Above, next to the menu, I see a bell without number: I have nothing pending ... for now.

A while before my first talk, a subtle notice appears below the screen: "Start at 10 min." It is a light toast: I do not cover what I am doing. If I play the notice, I go straight to the detail of the talk; If not, it disappears only a few seconds. As I recorded several, I receive 2 or 3 notices in a row and use “close all” to clean the tail of one.

During the day, the app tells me when a talk "is in progress", when "is about to end" and in the end "it has ended." All without blocking me. If I lose a sign a moment, when returning, notifications are updated.

When I want to see everything calmly, I play the bell (now with a numerite). I enter the notification center, which shows the activities of the current day and allows me to filter all or not read, mark how read or eliminate several at the same time. Everything is ordered on compact cards, the texts are not cut off, and the buttons are comfortable to press.

I feel accompanied, not persecuted:

- I only receive notices from my registered talks.
- If many arrive, I can close them or then manage them in the bell.
- The mobile looks clean, readable and accessible (good contrast, visible focus, without lateral scroll).

Result: I get on time, I don't miss anything and the app never gets in my way.
