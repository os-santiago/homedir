# User history - "Insurance Control Panel for Organizers"

I am Laura, part of the organizing team. Income with my authorized email and the app shows me the admin section. From there I create events, scenarios and talks with clear forms and live validations.

I can edit details, load images and schedule schedules without fear of breaking anything: only listed administrators can enter here.

I feel in control:

- Everything is grouped by event and talk.
- The changes are saved immediately.
- No one without permission can see this section.

Result: I organize the complete program without depending on external tools.
