# Homedir Philosophy & Principles

## Vision
**Homedir** is the digital home for technical communities. We believe in providing a platform that treats community work as **professional development**, not just a hobby.

## Core Principles
1. **Real Work**: No simulations. We gamify production issues and real projects.
2. **Open Ecosystem**: Built on open standards, open source (OSPO), and interoperability.
3. **Identity**: Your Homedir profile is your verifiable career passport.

## Guardrails
- **Simplicity**: Trunk-based development, minimal dependencies.
- **Performance**: Standard browser technologies (Standard Web) over heavy frameworks.
- **Security**: Secure by design, minimal PII storage.

## Contribution Codex
1. **Be Kind**: We are a community first.
2. **Be Professional**: Treat this repo as a production workspace.
3. **Be Concise**: Communication should be clear and direct.
