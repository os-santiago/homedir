# Start sections

The home page now differentiates events in two blocks:

## Available events
- Ordered from the closest to the furthest.
- Automatic classification according to the date/time of the event.
- Badge `in progress` when the event has already started but it still does not end.
- Start Microcopy: `Start today's,` starts in X days `or` date to be confirmed.
- Empty state: *"There are no next events for now. Come back ğŸ‘€" *

## Past events
- Ordered from the most recent to the oldest.
- Badge `finished 'for all listed events.
- They are shown with an appearance equivalent to the available events, but in gray scale to indicate that they have already finished.
- Empty state: *"We still don't have previous events." *

> Captures before/then pending.
