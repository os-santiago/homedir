# User history - "Explore and record talks at my pace"

I am Javier. From my laptop I enter Eventflow and see the clues and talks available. I frame as favorites that interest me and my personal agenda is updated instantly.

While I can filter by theme, schedule or speaker, and each talk has its card with description, room and a button to add or remove it from my list. On mobile view it adapts and I can reorganize my day with a thumb.

I feel the owner of my agenda:

- I see the whole offer without losing myself in menus.
- Registration or Quito talks with a touch.
- My plan is synchronized in all my devices.

Result: Armo my plan in minutes and I know exactly where to be and when.
