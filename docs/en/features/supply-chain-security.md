# User history - "end -to -end trust"

I am Elena, in charge of Devops. Every time we publish a version, Eventflow generates Sboms and signs the images of the container. The pipeline scan an dependencies and alerts me if a vulnerability appears.

From a panel I can see the reports and share them with external audits. I know exactly what bookstore we use and what version.

I feel calm:

- The code and images have traceability.
- Problems are detected before reaching production.
- I can prove that we follow good security practices.

Result: We deliver a reliable application without surprises.
