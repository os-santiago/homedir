# User history - "Enter with my Google account in seconds"

I am Mary. I arrive at the Eventflow site and instead of creating another password, I press "Continue with Google". Authorize and ready: I ​​am already inside with my name and photo.

I can check my saved talks or create new ones without extra steps. If I close session, I know that next time a touch will suffice to return.

I feel friction:

- I don't remember passwords.
- I use the same identity in all my devices.
- I can revoke access from Google whenever you want.

Result: Fast and sure start that leaves me time for the important.
