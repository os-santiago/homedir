# User experience - Why is Eventflow for me?

Eventflow helps me plan and enjoy events without friction. These stories show how each functionality is lived:

-[Explore and record talks at my pace] (features/event-discovery-registration.md)
-[Enter with my Google account in seconds] (features/google-sign-in.md)
- [Safe control panel for organizers] (features/admin-area.md)
- [Mass load without pain] (features/import-events.md)
- [Notifications that accompany me without hindering] (features/notifications.md)
-[end-to-end confidence] (features/supply-chain-security.md)

Each experience is intended for the application to adapt to me, not the other way around.
